# NOTE
The code here uses the old RNA Seq pipeline. 
Nowaday, it is better to use tools such as Salmon and tximport as suggested by the big names in RNA Seq. 
For more details, you can read [here](https://www.bioconductor.org/help/course-materials/2016/CSAMA/lect-07-modern-rnaseq/ModernRNAseqAnalysis.pdf)

This git will contain codes I used for the analysis of RNA Sequencing data, including the aligment, differential gene expression and also the WGCNA analysis
